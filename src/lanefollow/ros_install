# build raspicam_node: https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/raspicam_node
	Go to your catkin_ws cd ~/catkin_ws/src.

	Download the source for this node by running

	git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/raspicam_node.git

	There are some dependencies that are not recognized by ros, so you need to create the file /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/30-ubiquity.list and add this to it.

	yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UbiquityRobotics/rosdep/master/raspberry-pi.yaml
	Then run rosdep update.

	Install the ros dependencies,

	cd ~/catkin_ws
	rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
	Compile the code with catkin_make.

# enable camera : https://larrylisky.com/2016/11/24/enabling-raspberry-pi-camera-v2-under-ubuntu-mate/
Install raspi-config and rpi-update:
     sudo apt-get install raspi-config rpi-update
Run raspi-config to enable camera:
     sudo raspi-config
Enable camera, finish, and reboot. Next, make sure /boot/config.txt has the following enabled:
     start_x=1
     gpu_mem=128
Now run sudo rpi-update to update firmware. ########

#Running the Node
	Once you have the node built, you can run it using a launch file.

	For a V2.x camera, run roslaunch raspicam_node camerav2_1280x960.launch

	For a V1.x camera, run roslaunch raspicam_node camerav1_1280x720.launch

	Use rqt_image_view on a connected computer to view the published image.
